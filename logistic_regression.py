Implementing logistic regression for classification problem
Logistic regression is a machine learning technique used
for classification or prediction in data sets which have
many features, but where most of them have little value
and should be ignored

For example, imagine that you have several algorithms for
analyzing your photos. Some are good at converting images to
text, others are good at detecting objects in photos but not
for recognizing people√¨s faces, and others still focus on
finding patterns in color schemes.Now say you have an image
with two people in it: one smiling and the other frowning-
which one is the happier of the two? You need more than just
judging by appearances. You want to learn what makes people
happy and sad, so instead of having various algorithms that
each specialize in identifying different emotions, you want
an algorithm that knows how to recognize both emotions
equally well. In such cases, using a maching learning
algorithm like logistic regression can help you acheive
your goal more effectively.
